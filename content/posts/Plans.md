1. # Read Harer PhD thesis before next week
2. # Try to read Scorpan (3->12). A chapter everyday, thinking about what is he saying and way. No more than 1 chapter a day.
3. # Try to write something for the seminar, but not too much, this should only be done when really tired. I will have time in the holidays to finish this. 
4. # Try to get a feeling for Etnyre-Fuller (Geiges is the reference for contact structure, I should read about stabilization)
