# The handbook of Exotica.

Exotica is a phenomenon first discovered by J.W. Milnor in the '60es. Here we are mostly interested in (surfaces in) 4-Manfifolds. We don't know a lot about exotic manifolds but what we do comes from many (related) fields of mathematics. Here just a brief collection of some keywords related to the main problems. 

1. [Fintushel&Stern] Their toric surgery in K3 surfaces is still today one of the best understood and "classic" way to build exotica. The check that our manifolds are indeed exotica is due to SW-Theory.

We were really lucky and found a guide in our trip in *Exoticaland*. Here are the plans that he helped us think of:
