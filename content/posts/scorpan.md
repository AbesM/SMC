# Chapter 3 Intersection Form   

- In 4-manifolds all homology classes can be represented by embedded surfaces. For 2-homology it is "easy".
- He gives a suggestive way of eliminating double points via Hopf-Fibration, think about it.
- Elements in $H^2(M,Z)$ corresponds to complex line bundle on $M$. This is because $CP^\infty$ is the classifying space of the group $U(1)$. Then the 0 section is the surface Poincar√©-dual to the cohomology element [...]
