As always when you try to do math you need to have a box with as many tools as possible. Here some things that I should dive into more carefully in the next months. 

# From Fintushel & Stern

1. Elliptic Fibrations
2. Basic Classes -> Basically SW is an integer valued function on $Spin^c$ structure. Now if $H_1(X,Z)$ has no 2-torsion there is a natural identification between this and characteristic elements of $H^2(X,\mathbb{Z})$. We call a class $\beta$ basic is $SW_X(\beta)\neq 0$ 
3. Adjunction Inequality. 
4. Pushoffs in bundles.
