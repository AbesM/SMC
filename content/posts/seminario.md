# Observation on the seminar
 
 1. W is homotopy equivalent to a circle because it is just a deformation retract of $S^5\setminus \varphi(S^3)$. Hence is it is homotopy equivalent to $\D^4\times S^1$.
 2. Need to learn Palais results (basically he can extend diffeomorphism from nghood of k-cells)
 3. Need to learn how to promote homotopy maps for $S^1\times S^4$.
