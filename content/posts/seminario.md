# Observation on the seminar
 
 1. W is homotopy equivalent to a circle because it is just a deformation retract of $S^5\setminus \varphi(S^3)$. Hence is it is homotopy equivalent to $\D^4\times S^1$.
 2. Need to learn Palais results (basically he can extend diffeomorphism from nghood of k-cells)
 3. Need to learn how to promote homotopy maps for $S^1\times S^4$.
 4. 


 # 22/01/25 

  We are just going to do a quick recap of where we are right now. The problem of theorem 2 arises when we are gluing our boundary $S^n$. If the diffeomorphisms are not isotopic to the identity we get twisted spheres as in Milnor's work.

  # Q: 
  1) Why does Levine fail in dimension lower?
  2) Can we get any details on the need of being orientation preserving as map?
