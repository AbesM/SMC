# Chapter 4
- It only gives a brief overview about handle sliding and cancellation. More details are in Milnor's h-cobordism theorem.
- In general attaching k-handles to a 0-handle via an unknot is how we build $D^{n-k}$ bundles over $S^k$. This is a slight generalization of the twisted 2-sphere bundle.
- It shows how to get handles decomposition of product given handle decomposition of the factor (lower dimension)
- Plumbings (not really clear to be seen again)
- Disk bundle over general surfaces (can be understood better and uses some terminology of char classes).
