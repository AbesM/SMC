# Stipsicz Szabo'

- Following LLP we have some of the first examples of definite positive exotic manifolds (with non trivial fundamental group). SS will use torus surgery (Luttinger if and when needed). 
- SW invariant are hopeless for a negative definite (oriented, closed, smooth) 4-manifolds with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fundamental group. Nevertheless we will be able to distinguish exotica through universal covering.

# 2. Background 

## After Hambleton and Kreck

- Closed, oriented 4m with finite cyclic fundamental group and their universal cover are quite well understood in terms of their intersection form after Hambleton-Kreck.
- If we have negative def interesection form, Z2 group and $b_2>0$ we have that $\Chi$ decides the homeo type.

##  Surgery

- (Torus surgery) We briefly recall surgery along a torus as in FPS. Suppose we got a torus with 0 self-intersection number. We can consider a framing of its normal bundle. Chosen a closed curve c we call $(p,q)$ surgery sending a meridian to p meridian+q c.
- (Luttinger surgery) If the torus was Lagrangian and we do $(1,k)$ surgery for $k\in\mathbb{Z}$ we keep a symplectic manifold.  

## SW Invariants.
- For us SW will be a map from Spin-c to the integers. We should be more precise on this and on its vanishing. Here the key idea is to use SW of the covering space to discuss exotica of the base manifold.
-SW invariants and torus surgery are quite well understood after (Morgan, Mrowka, Szabo)

# 3. Exotic structure on definite manifolds with $b_2=2$ 

 The goal for this section is the following. We start with a genus 2 surface with self-intersection 0 in $T^4\#2\overline{CP}^2$. We do 4 torus surgeries and we get a sequence of manifolds $X_n$. We will have manifolds homeomorphic, not diffeo and with a given natural involution. We distinguish them through SW. 

 ## Construction of the 4-mfds 

    - We will do some torus surgery, ideas are from Baldridge-Kirk
    - We will view $T^4$ as the quotient of the 4-cube. We fix two tori $T_1, T_2$ and observe that we can find a $M_0$ particular submanifold disjoint from both of them. We also want to consider some other $H,K$ submanifolds. We are in a position where the product $H\times K$ contains $T_1, T_2$ and the 4 loops $x,y,a,b.$
    - The construction above continuos, it is not trivial at all and for more details BK.

    We are left with a smooth manifolds $X_n$ that admits a fixed-point-free, orientation preserving involution $\iota_n$. We denote the manifolds as $P(-1,-n,-1,-n)$. 

    - In what follow SS work to show that it is simply-connected, calculate signature and $\Chi$ resulting in the pindown of the homeo type of $X_n$ after Freedman.
    - They also do quite some work to compute the SW invariants of such manifolds.
