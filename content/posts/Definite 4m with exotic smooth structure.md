- Following LLP we have some of the first examples of definite positive exotic manifolds (with non trivial fundamental group). SS will use torus surgery (Luttinger if and when needed). 
- SW invariant are hopeless for a negative definite (oriented, closed, smooth) 4-manifolds with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fundamental group. Nevertheless we will be able to distinguish exotica through universal covering.
