# Stipsicz Szabo'

- Following LLP we have some of the first examples of definite positive exotic manifolds (with non trivial fundamental group). SS will use torus surgery (Luttinger if and when needed). 
- SW invariant are hopeless for a negative definite (oriented, closed, smooth) 4-manifolds with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fundamental group. Nevertheless we will be able to distinguish exotica through universal covering.

# 2. Background 

## After Hambleton and Kreck

- Closed, oriented 4m with finite cyclic fundamental group and their universal cover are quite well understood in terms of their intersection form after Hambleton-Kreck.
- If we have negative def interesection form, Z2 group and $b_2>0$ we have that $\Chi$ decides the homeo type.
