What follows are just some notes taken while trying to learn more about contact structure in order to understand open book decomposition related to Lefschetz Fibration

# "Introductory Lectures on Contact Geometry" John B. Etnyre

- Locally one can always represent a plane field as the kernel of a 1-form. 
- A plane field is a contact structure if for any $\alpha$ such that the plane is $\ker\alpha$ it holds: $\alpha\wedge d\alpha\neq 0$. 
- Just a silly reminder, if we are given a manifold as the counterimage of a regular value the tangent space is just the kernel of the differential.
- A contact structure is Stein Fillable if it is produced via a properly strictly plurisubharmonic function $\phi: X\to R$
- Because of Darbouxâ€™s Theorem contact structure are interesting as global phenomena, not local.
- Overtwisted vs tight
- A knot is Legendrian if tangent to the plane field. Transverse if...

# "Lectures on Open Book Decomposition" 
- Basically we have that stabilization is adding a 1-handle and Dehn Twisting over a curve that intersect once the cocore of the new handle.
