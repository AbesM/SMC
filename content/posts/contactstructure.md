What follows are just some notes taken while trying to learn more about contact structure in order to understand open book decomposition related to Lefschetz Fibration

# "Introductory Lectures on Contact Geometry" John B. Etnyre

- Locally one can always represent a plane field as the kernel of a 1-form. 
- A plane field is a contact structure if for any $\alpha$ such that the plane is $\ker\alpha$ it holds: $\alpha\wedge d\alpha\neq 0$.
