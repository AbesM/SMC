1. Immersed maps are dense in continuous.
2. Just a silly remark. Changing orientation is just changing the "sign" of the fundamental class hence it implies changing the intersection form as we see it as landing in the last (co-)homology group. Silly me.
3. Calculating intersection forms can be reduced to counting linking numbers, that is because we can imagine seifert surfaces and pushing one of them in the interior of the ball. What is left is the Seifert surface of one of the knot, and the knot that we "pushed". When we consider self-linking number it is the framing by definition basically, just think about it. (when they have 0 and 2 handles)
4. Why should the intersection form be unimodular?
