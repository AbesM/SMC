# Exotic 4-mfds with signature zero
We want to show that we can build exotic signature 0 exotic manifolds. 

# 1. Introduction 
We will do surgery on Lagrangian tori in symplectic 4-manifolds explicitely described as LF over a genus-2 surface.

# 2. Preliminaries
 
 - We start by recalling basics of LF and the relations of braiding, lantern and 4holed torus in $MCG(\Sigma_g^b)$
 - By Gompf-Thurston suitable LF are symplectic. We take suitable LF. 
- Remarks on torus surgery and a lemma that shows how we can "control" fundamental groups. Remark 3 might be useful. 

## 2.3 Spin structures and LF. 

Given a $s$ spin-structure we can associate a quadratic form. We consider the spin mapping class group. We can relate the existence of a spin structure on $X$ so the monodromy factorization.
