# On 4-mfds w/o 1-3 handles. 

# 1. Introduction

 A Morse Function is said to be perfect if the number of its critical points is equal to the sum of its Betti numbers. In this paper Inan√ß will answer negatively to Shkolnikov: 

 *Is any closed, simply connected, 4-manifolds $X$ with signature 0 and admitting a perfect Morse function diffeo to connected sum of one of the $S^2$ bundles over $S^2$?.* 

 The negative answer will follow from the more general: 

 **Thm**: There exists irreducible, closed, simply connected 4-mfds that admit perfect Morse functions, where the 4-mfds have prescribed signature and spin type (when 16 | $\sigma$), and arbitrarly large Euler characteristic. 

 In general all the previous exotic construction for connected sum of $S^2$ bundles did not have any control on the handles decomposition. Here (building on Baykur-Hamada) we get manifolds from LF and so have more control.

 # 2. Proof and Examples 

 We will work with relatively minimal Lefschetz fibration. 

 -*The Recipe* Consider the handle decomposition on the complement of the tubular neigh of a regular fiber. Consider the standard geometric basis of $H_1(\Sigma_g),$ which can be used to label the 1-handles. Let $X\to S^2$ be a genus $g$ LF with signature $\sigma(X)=0$. By Endo this implies $g\goe 3. (Endo).$
