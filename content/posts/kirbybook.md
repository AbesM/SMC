# Kirby Book

What follows are some random thoughts about the book "The topology of 4-Manifolds" of Rob Kirby. MY final goal is to get to understand the proof of the celebrated Rokhlin theorem about signature of 4 manifolds. As suggested by Kirby a good companion for the read might be Milnor-Stasheff for some details about cc.   

# Chapter 1

- The first note that he does is that what we always "hide" about handles decomposition is in an old paper of Cerf.
- "Changing" 1-handle to a 2-handle is like doing surgery on the S^1 defined by the 1-handle. In "calculus lingo" doing surgery is removing the dot in favor of a 0 framed 2 handles. (Akbulut says the same thing.)
- Here we have some interesting lemmas and exercises that can be really instructive imho. He also give a "Kirby translation" of blowing up/ blowing down.
- Chapter ends with some interesting (but hard as historical!) problems.

# Chapter 2
- Cool proof that homology classes with integers coeff. are represented by surfaces. 
- Unimodular can be tought as that it is representable (?)
- Milnor-Whitehead: isomorphism of intersection forms gives homotopy equivalence for s.c. closed, orientable 4-manifold.

# Chapter 3 
This is a compendium of some of the most notable results in 4 manifolds up to (his) date.

# Chapter 4 (Spin Structure)
- He gives 'sorta' of 3 different equivalent definition of Spin Structure. I don't actually get any of that.
