# Remarks
The following are some remarks about the leitmotivs of the theory:
1. If we do $\pom 1$ contact surgery on a knot L contained in a page of the open book we are adding a Dehn-Twist to the monodromy of our open book. 
2. The trivial LF $\Sigma \times D^2$ induces an open book decomposition on the boundary. We obtain a non-trivial LF attaching 2-handles along vanishing cycle, this corresponds to contact surgery hence we are twisting the OBD via point 1.
3. We can stabilize Legendrian Knots on a page of the OBD so that they stay on the same page. 

# Baykur
- He explains LOBD and is the "better" paper as he gives structure to the handlebody to create Lefschetz Structure.


# Harer
- Harer gives the proof of his theorem at page 14 of his PhD thesis.

# Etnyre-Fuller 

I just list some things that are not really clear and I might like to discuss with someone. 
 
1. When we do connected sum of a torus is just because we need the first handle to resolve the double point and the second handle to keep the fiber as an oriented manifold? 
2. What I am using in the proof of 5.1 is Eliashberg (Gompf) + Eliashberg,Gromov?
3. The Legendrian realization principle.
4. ~~Contact framing.~~  To be read in Etnyre-Honda
5. ~~What it is the restriction to 2 for them?~~ It is just that $c_1$ has the same parity as $\omega_2$ and every 3 manifold is spin.
6. ~~How (negative) stabilization of ALF overtwist the induced contact structure? ~~  This is explained in Etnyre's "OPD and CS".
7. For learning more about Contact Surgery must read Ding-Geiges-Stipsicz
8. Why is it so obvious that stabilization of the contact structure does not change Chern classes? Is it because we are just saying in the same homotopy class right?
