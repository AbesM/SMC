# Baykur
- He explains LOBD and is the "better" paper as he gives structure to the handlebody to create Lefschetz Structure.


# Harer
- Harer gives the proof of his theorem at page 14 of his PhD thesis.

# Etnyre-Fuller 

I just list some things that are not really clear and I might like to discuss with someone. 
 
1. When we do connected sum of a torus is just because we need the first handle to resolve the double point and the second handle to keep the fiber as an oriented manifold? 
2. What I am using in the proof of 5.1 is Eliashberg (Gompf) + Eliashberg,Gromov?
3. The Legendrian realization principle.
4. ~~Contact framing.~~  To be read in Etnyre-Honda
5. What it is the restriction to 2 for them?
6. ~~How (negative) stabilization of ALF overtwist the induced contact structure? ~~  This is explained in Etnyre's "OPD and CS"
